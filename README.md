  # 1. Locate the Add Book Feature

 On your main page or book list page, look for a button or link labeled **“Add Book”**.
 Clicking this button will either open a modal or navigate you to a page containing the `BookForm.vue` component.

# 2. Understand the BookForm.vue Structure

A typical `BookForm.vue` component looks like this:
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="bookSubmit(bookTitle, bookAuthor)">
    <input v-model="bookTitle" placeholder="Title" />
    <input v-model="bookAuthor" placeholder="Author" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      bookTitle: '',
      bookAuthor: ''
    }
  },
  methods: {
    bookSubmit(title, author) {
      // Emit the new book data to the parent component
      this.$emit('add-book', { title, author });
      // Optionally, you can send the data to a backend API here
      // axios.post('/api/books', { title, author })
      // Clear the input fields after submission
      this.bookTitle = '';
      this.bookAuthor = '';
    }
  }
}
</script>

**Key Points:**
 The form uses `@submit.prevent` to handle submission with the `bookSubmit` method and prevent page reload.
 `v-model` binds the input fields to the component’s data.
 The `bookSubmit` method emits the new book data to the parent or sends it to an API, then clears the form.

# 3. Fill in the Book Information

 Enter the **title** and **author** of the book in the respective input fields.

# 4. Submit the Form

 Click the **Submit** button.
 The `bookSubmit` method is triggered, which either emits the new book data to the parent component or sends it to the backend.

# 5. Update the Book List

 If the parent component listens for the `add-book` event, it should update the book list to include the new entry.
 If you use an API, ensure the frontend fetches the updated list after a successful addition.

# 6. Example: Parent Component Usage

Suppose your parent component (e.g., `BookList.vue`) uses `BookForm.vue` like this:
<BookForm @add-book="addBookToList" />

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      books: []
    }
  },
  methods: {
    addBookToList(newBook) {
      this.books.push(newBook);
      // Or fetch the updated list from the backend
    }
  }
}
</script>

# Summary

1. Click “Add Book” to open the form.
2. Fill in the title and author.
3. Submit the form.
4. The new book is added to the list, either via event or API.
5. The form clears for the next entry.
