## Usage Instructions  

1. Ensure Vue.js and Vue Router are installed

## Data Flow Explanation  

- Current implementation uses component-internal data for book storage (demo purposes)  
- In real projects, it is recommended to use Vuex or API calls for data management  
- Components communicate via props/events  
- Route parameters are used to pass book data for editing  

## Extension Suggestions  

- Add more detailed form validation rules  
- Implement actual backend data persistence  
- Add book categorization/search functionality
